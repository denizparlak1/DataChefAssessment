# Performance Evaluation

## Test Overview

I conducted manual testing of the API using Postman to assess its response time. Although it wasn't a formal performance test, i gained insights into the API's performance characteristics.

## Test Results

During our manual testing, i recorded an average response time of approximately **105ms** for the API requests. This indicates a reasonably fast response from the server.

## Observations

Based on our observations, the API demonstrated satisfactory performance for the given workload. However, it's important to note that this assessment was conducted under controlled conditions with limited concurrent users. Further comprehensive performance testing is recommended to evaluate the system's behavior under higher loads.

## Potential Areas for Improvement

To optimize the API's performance and prepare for future scalability, the following areas can be considered:

1. **Scaling Infrastructure**: As the workload increases, scaling the infrastructure by upgrading the EC2 instance or adopting a larger instance type can improve performance by providing additional resources to handle higher loads.

2. **Load Balancing**: Implementing a load balancer in front of multiple API instances can distribute the incoming traffic and ensure better utilization of resources.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, based on our manual testing, the API demonstrated satisfactory performance with an average response time of approximately **105ms**. However, it is essential to conduct formal performance testing to evaluate the system's behavior under different loads and uncover any potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
